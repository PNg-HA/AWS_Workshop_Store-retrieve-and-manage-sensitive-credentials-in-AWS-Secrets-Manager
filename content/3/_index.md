In this module you will update your sample application to retrieve credentials from AWS Secrets Manager. You can use this demonstration to understand how to programmatically retrieve secrets in an application without humans seeing plaintext secret values. You will also see how to use AWS IAM PrincipalTag and ResourceTag condition keys to implement attribute-based access control (ABAC).

This module has 2 tasks:
